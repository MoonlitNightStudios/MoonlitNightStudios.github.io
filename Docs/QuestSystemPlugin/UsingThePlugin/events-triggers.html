									<h2>Triggers</h2>
									<p>Triggers are used to activate quests when a condition is met. For example, if a quest should start after speaking with an NPC, this can be done using trigger action that completes when the NPC has been spoken to.</p>
									<p>
										Triggers are just actions marked with <strong>Make Trigger</strong> meta data specifier. Triggers are activated when an action sequence is initlaised. These then behave like actions and perform their task. Once completed, they will broadcast the <strong>OnCompleted</strong> pin. When a trigger completes, the owning action sequence will get activated.
									</p>

									<h2>Events</h2>
									<p>
										Events are similar to triggers but they are activated when the owning action sequence activates. These then fire when their conditions are met. For example, if you want a specific cinematic to play when the player reaches a location, events can be useful. The <strong>Reach Location</strong> objective has an events variant which can be used in this case.

										Events are actions marked with <strong>Make Event</strong> meta data specifier.
