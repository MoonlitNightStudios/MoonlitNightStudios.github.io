									<h2>Creating the quest asset</h2>
									<ol>
										<li><p>Right click on the content browser, go to the <strong>Quest System</strong> section and select <strong>Action Sequence</strong>.</p></li>
										<li><p>Select Quest as the class to create your asset and click Ok.</p></li>
										<li><p>Name your quest asset. We recommend prefixing your asset with <strong>Q_</strong> so your quest asset will be <strong>Q_YourFirstQuest</strong>.</p></li>
										<li><p>Your quest asset is ready for you to work with!.</p></li>
									</ol>

									<h2>An intro to the quest editor</h2>
									<p>The quest editor interface is similar to other asset editors with graphs in Unreal Engine like the materials editor and sound editor.
										The editor has a details panel to show the details of the currently selected object, a graph canvas to script the quest with and 
										a pallete with all available actions for the quest.
									</p>
									<p>Right click on the graph to open the graph context menu. Right click on the nodes to open the node context menu.</p>
									<p>To add an action to your graph, drag and drop the action from the palette or right click on the graph and select the action to add.</p>
									<p>Every quest asset has a begin node. This node will fire when the quest is activated. Any actions connected to this node will be activated.</p>
									<h3>Anatomy of a node</h3>
									<p>Every node has an unnamed pin at the right end of the title bar. This pin is a property pin and is the reference to the action represented by the node. All exposed functions for the action will be 
										shown as red input pins. All exposed delegates will be shown as red output pins. All input properties will be shown as yellow input pins and all output properties will be shown as yellow output pins.
									</p>

									<h2>Quest lifecycle</h2>
									<p>Quests assets are just templates for the quest. The Quest Subsystem duplicates quests to run. When a quest is duplicated by the quest subsystem 
										and added to the managed list of quests, it is marked as <i>Loaded</i>.</p>
									<p>A loaded quest needs to be activated for the quest to start. Quests marked as <i>Auto Activate = true</i> will be automatically activated by the 
									quest subsystem when it is loaded. Other quests need to be manually activated by calling activate on the quests. Another way to activate quests is by using <i>Triggers</i>.
									Triggers are actions inside a quest that get activated as soon as a quest is loaded. When a trigger's requirements are satisfied, it will activate the quest.</p>
									<p>An active quest can be deactivated. A deactivated quest is dormant until reactivated. When reactivated, the quest will resume from the point where it was deactivated.</p>
									<p>The last state a quest can be in is <i>Ended</i>. A quest can be marked as ended when it is completed, failed, etc. A quest that has ended cannot be reactivated. <strong>Do note that marking quests as failed is not supported out of the box.</strong></p>

									<h2>Example quest</h2>
									<p>Lets create our very first quest! Follow the steps below to create a simple quest where the character walks to a location, an actor is spawned into the world, and the character goes to the spawned actor.</p>
									<p>Lets setup the world first. These actors will be useful in the quest editor to define the locations for the reach location objective and spawn actor action.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><p>Add a trigger volume to the world to the location you want the character to reach as part of the quest.</p></li>
										<li><p>Add another trigger volume in the location where you want to spawn the actor from the quest graph. This trigger volume will also be used
											by the secind reach location objective.
										</p></li>
										<li><p>Create an actor blueprint <i>BP_TestActor</i>. Add a static mesh component to it and set the mesh asset to the default cube. This is the actor we will spawn during the quest.</p></li>
									</ol>
									<p>Now that the world is setup, lets create the quest graph.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><p>Create a quest asset. lets call it <i>Q_FirstQuest</i>.</p></li>
										<li><p>Open the quest asset. Add a <b>Reach Location</b> node to the graph and connect the begin node's output pin to the activate pin of the new node. 
										In the details panel, set the location to the first trigger volume.</p></li>
										<li><p>Add a <b>Spawn Actor</b> node and connect the completed pin of the <b>Reach Location</b> node to the activate pin of the new node. In the details panel, set the actor class 
										to <i>BP_TestActor</i> and the location to the second trigger volume.</p></li>
										<li><p>Add another <b>Reach Location</b> node to the graph and connect the <b>Spawn Actor</b> node's completed pin to the activate pin of the new node. 
											In the details panel, set the location to the second trigger volume.</p></li>
										<li><p><span class = "icon solid fa-exclamation"></span> <strong>[Important]</strong> Add a complete action node. This node is important as this calls the complete function on the quest and marks it as <i>Ended</i>.
										 Without this node, the quest will be perpetually active. Connect the Completed pin of the second <b>Reach Location</b> node to the new node.</p></li>
										<li><p>We want this quest to activate automatically. So go to the details panel and set <strong>Auto Activate</strong> to true.</p></li>
									</ol>
