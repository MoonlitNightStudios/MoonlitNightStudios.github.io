						<h2>Quest and Dialogue System plugin</h2>
						<p>
							I started working on this as a learning project and then kept adding features as a hobby. This showed promise so I polished it and published it on the <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/e0208c24-8a1d-40ed-9bf6-dda679152940" target="_blank">Fab marketplace</a>!

						Published under the name Moonlit Night Studios. Read more about the plugin <a href="https://moonlitnightstudios.com/Plugins/quest-system.html" target="_blank">here</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						This plugin provides <b>tools</b> for <b>scripting</b> quests and dialogues in a graph editor, <b>debugging tools</b> in editor, Editor-only cheats for testing, and a <b>framework</b> and <b>workflow</b> for creating and managing quests in Unreal Engine. It is also <b>modular</b> and easily extensible in C++ and blueprints so can be tailored to suit any project.

								Game launcher
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Wrote a simple game launcher using <b>WPF</b> in <b>c#</b> using <b>.Net core 8</b>. This was a simple project to learn how to develop .net applications in WPF. This launcher searches for Unreal Engine projects in a directory and provides buttons to choose the game to launch.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, this launcher can download game files hosted on Google drive. It can check for updates using a version value provided in a version file and can download a new version of the game files when the version on Google Drive changes.

							<h2>Runtime NPC dialogue generation
							</h2>
							<p>
								Using generative AI
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Used <b>ConvAI</b> and <b>InWorld</b> to generate dialogues for NPC at runtime. The project uses ConvAI API and InWorld API to query the respective servers to generate dialogues for NPCs in Unreal Engine, given a context.
						</p>
						<p>
							Context in this case can be a predefined <b>world state</b> (like a crime scene with theft or murder, etc) and player questions to an NPC such as <b i>“Hello, I am the investigator investigating this crime scene. Can you tell me what you saw?”</b i>. A voice component listens to the microphone, converts player's speech to text and then sends it to the Servers to be processed. The servers then generate a reply and send it to the game client, speech is synthesised from that text, which will be played as an audio in game.

							<h2>Parkour movement system for characters
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Built a parkour movement system in Unreal Engine that is capable of <b>sprinting</b>, <b>climbing walls</b>, <b>hanging from ledges</b>, <b>shimmying left and right</b>, <b>jumping across gaps</b>, and <b>wall running</b>. Animation assets were taken from Mixamo and were retargeted to Unreal Engine’s Mannequin.
						</p>
						<p>
							Improved upon the project by using <b>Inverse Kinematics</b> in the animation blueprint to make sure the bones on the character model are placed perfectly on the surface of a ledge when shimmying up or down a slanted ledge. This also limited hand position to the edge of the ledge so the hands are not extending beyond the end of the wall.
