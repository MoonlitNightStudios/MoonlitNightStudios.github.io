						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>
							I am Srinath, a video game programmer who specializes in gameplay programming and developing tools for the unreal engine editor. This is my portfolio! But before that, here's a little about myself.
						</p>
					</header>
					<p>I love action adventure games, RPGs and simple indie games with interesting game designs. Some of my favorite games include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sekiro: Shadows die twice</li>
						<li>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</li>
						<li>Black Myth Wukong</li>
						<li>Ori and the Blind Forest & Ori and the Will of the Wisps</li>
						<li>Tunic</li>
						<li>The Darksiders franchise</li>
						<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
						<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						There are even more but this is already a long list! Outside of gaming I love cooking and hiking. I love to try new cuisines from all over the world. I used to tinker with robots and I am planning on buying a 3D printer soon so I can get back to building some new ones. So maybe you can expect to see robots here sometime!
					</p>
					<p>
						I also like learning more about the gaming industry and creating new games and tools in Unreal Engine. My experience in game dev has been primarily using Unreal Engine but I have also worked with Unity and have worked with propritary engines written in C++.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also designed a few games as a hobby, prepared references, concepts, put together a Game Design Document and worked on prototyping them.
